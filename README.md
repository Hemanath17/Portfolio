## Portfolio
A programmer portfolio is more than a simple resume. In essence, it is a showcase that proves that you can do what you talk about in your resume. Rather than telling prospective employers about your skills, you can create a software developer portfolio to show them.

Portfolio made of css, html and vanilla js has been deployed by Heroku App.
